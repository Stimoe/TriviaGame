# TriviaGame


This project is a Trivia game about Coffee!

This is an example of using Jquery with javascript, timing, and hideing and showing content.

To use the project, load it in a browser, play the trivia, then take a look at the code to see what it does.

To get help with the project you can contact me on on my profile page on git hub, https://stimoe.github.io/Thomas-Portfolio-Page/

This project is maintained and by myself, Thomas Stimac, and I am the sole contributor.
